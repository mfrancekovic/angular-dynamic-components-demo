# Angular Dynamic Components Demo

This is a demo project to showcase how to use ComponentResolverFactory in Angular to create a grid
like view.

The idea is to avoid using *ngIf and have overbloated template which covers multiple grid items. But instead to define
multiple templates as small components, style each one separately and then depending on the data set render the component
which fits the grid item.

The demo uses Bootstrap 4.0.0. beta for styling.
